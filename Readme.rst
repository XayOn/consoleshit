Installation
============

** Please, please, please backup your .bashrc, .zshrc and .vim* **
It should not break them, but it modifies them so it's best to do so.

To install prettierTerminal, just **execute as your user pt.bash**

::

    bash build/pt.bash

Or, if you dare you can **execute it directly**

::

    wget https://github.com/XayOn/prettierTerminal/raw/master/src/build/pt.bash -O - | bash


**Minimal requirements are vim, and (bash or zsh).**
For a better experience I recommend **xfce4-terminal** and **tmux**.

On debian and derivatives you could install all the deps with

::

    apt-get install tmux xfce4-terminal zsh vim bash



More info
=========

Have a look at the `Autogenerated docs </docs/api.rst>`_

This project *heavily* depends on vim. If you've got any problem with vim:
