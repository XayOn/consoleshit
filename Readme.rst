What does it offer
==================

- **Awesomeness** :wink:
- Same style (airline) on vim and zsh 
- Neovim configuration for python with goodies
- Solarized theme 
- Automatic font configuration
- Auto-ls
- Automatically colored cat using 'bat'
- Install of poetry and nvm
- Enhanced LS with colors and icons

I've re-written prettierTerminal to make use of the amazing `ZPlug <https://github.com/zplug/zplug>`_

Usage
=====

Dependencies
++++++++++++

prettierTerminal will try to auto-install its dependencies on debian/ubuntu.

In case you're using any other linux flavour you should install: 

- neovim
- zsh

::

    apt-get install tmux xfce4-terminal zsh vim bash

Installation
++++++++++++

To install prettierTerminal, just **execute as your user install.bash** 

For a better experience I recommend **gnome-terminal**
