What does it offer
==================

- **Awesomeness** :wink:
- Same style on vim and tmux
- Awesome style in zsh (can be made the same as vim and tmux by removing purepower) 
- Neovim configuration for python with goodies
- Automatic font configuration
- Auto-ls
- Automatically colored cat using 'bat'
- Install of poetry and nvm
- Enhanced LS with colors and icons

I've re-written prettierTerminal to make use of the amazing `ZPlug <https://github.com/zplug/zplug>`_

Usage
=====

Dependencies
++++++++++++

Basically everything is installed and contained in your $HOME. You only need:

- neovim
- zsh
- git
- tmux

::

    apt-get install tmux xfce4-terminal zsh vim bash

Installation
++++++++++++

To install prettierTerminal, just **execute as your user install.bash** 

NOTE: You can't execute the installer WITHIN tmux

For a better experience I recommend **gnome-terminal**
